Use Node.js and Angular.js to create an interface able to read and list, create, update, and delete data in a RESTful API.
The data can be anything as long as it has multiple columns. Example: People(name, company, job, salary)
The Node.js API should store the data in a MySQL database.
The list of data should be searchable and the search should not use Angular.js filters, but instead should use a MySQL query.

You can use any libraries you would like as long as the frontend uses Angular.js and the backend uses Node.js.
Things we're specifically looking for:
Architecture - (e.g. Why is specific logic in a specific place, reduction of redundancy)
Efficiency - (e.g. Minimizing redundancy, performance optimizations)
Transparency - (e.g. proper and thorough error handling, comments, readability etc...)

We care less about styling than we do about maintainable and reliable code. So don't spend too much time on the UI.

# Angular Agent Tracker

## Getting Started

### Setting up the Database

CREATE DATABASE agent_tracker
USE agent_tracker
CREATE TABLE agents
(
  id              BINARY(16),                           # Unique ID for the record
  status          VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,                # License Status
  firstName       VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,                # First name of agent
  lastName        VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,                # Last name of agent
  totalSales      DECIMAL(13, 4) NOT NULL,              # Total sales from homes sold
  grossCommission DECIMAL(13, 4) NOT NULL,              # Commission earned
  totalHomes      SMALLINT unsigned NOT NULL,           # Number of homes sold
  PRIMARY KEY     (id)
);

### Start the Server
Run the server before starting up the client
